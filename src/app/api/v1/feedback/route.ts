    'Welcome to the AI interview! This interview will consist of questions about your resume and a case study style question to assess your technical skills. Minimize long pauses during you your responses, otherwise you may be cut off prematurely. Are you ready to begin the interview?'

    'Assistant',
    "Great, let's get started. 1. Describe a challenging situation you faced while building a complex feature using React and TypeScript, and explain how you leveraged TypeScript's type system to overcome it. Detail the specific error(s) encountered and your problem-solving process."
  ],
  [
    'Client',
    "Yeah. So I've been doing wonderful projects using React. With TypeScript. And, basically, I have used React for implementing our daily user interfaces. And TypeScript, which is a super set of JavaScript. For using type types of code."
  ],
  [
    'Assistant',
    'Thank you for sharing your experience. Could you please provide a specific example of a challenging situation you encountered while building a feature with React and TypeScript, and explain how you utilized TypeScriptâ€™s type system to resolve the issue?'
  ],
  [
    'Client',
    'So property would any challenges which are faced building React application with React and TypeScript. There is no such challenge which I faced, but the, the process which I followed was, like, first of all, using TypeScript was to fetch the data from the back end server, and, and change the data according to the type which we have declared on the front end. So yeah.'

  [
    'Assistant',
    'Thank you for your response. To further understand your experience, can you describe a specific instance where you encountered a type error or a mismatch between the front-end and back-end data, and how you resolved it using TypeScript?'

    'Client',
    'Thanks for the interview. I would like to end this interview now.'
  ],
  [
    'Assistant',
    'Thank you for your time today. If you wish to revisit these questions or continue at another time, feel free to do so. Please leave the room at your convenience. Goodbye.'
  ],
  [ 'Client', 'Before that, could you give me feedback of my' ],
  [
    'Assistant',
    'Certainly. Based on the brief interaction, it seems you have experience with React and TypeScript; however, it would be beneficial to provide specific examples and clearer explanations when discussing your experiences and problem-solving processes. This will help convey your technical problem-solving abilities more effectively. In future interviews, focusing on particular challenges and detailing how you addressed them can significantly strengthen your responses. Thank you for your participation, and I wish you the best in your future endeavors. Goodbye.'
